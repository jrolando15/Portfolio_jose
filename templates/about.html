        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            As a Venezuelan native with a strong background in competitive swimming, I have developed a robust foundation in discipline, teamwork, and achieving objectives. My academic journey began at the age of 16, and I am set to graduate at 21 with dual majors in <strong>Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science</strong> from Long Island University. This accelerated path reflects my dedication and passion for learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            I chose <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> because it uniquely combines my interests in <strong>mathematics, physics, and computation</strong>, offering a cutting-edge field that represents the next step in technological innovation. Throughout my academic career, I have maintained a cumulative <strong>GPA of 3.7</strong>, demonstrating my commitment to academic excellence. Additionally, I am a proud member of the <strong>Honors College at Long Island University</strong>, which has provided me with a challenging and enriching academic environment.
